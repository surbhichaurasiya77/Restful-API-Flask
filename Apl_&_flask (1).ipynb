While these are the most frequently used, other methods like OPTIONS, HEAD, and TRACE exist as well.\n",

        "\n",
        "8. What is the difference between GET and POST HTTP methods?\n",
        "- The main difference between GET and POST methods in HTTP lies in how data is transmitted and used. GET retrieves data from a server, typically by including it in the URL, while POST sends data to a server, often for creating or updating resources, with data being sent in the request body.\n",

        "  * Data Transmission: Data is included in the URL as part of a query string.\n",

        "  * Side Effects: GET requests should not have side effects on the server (i.e., they should not modify data).\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Caching: GET requests are often cacheable.\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Security: Less secure because data is visible in the URL.\n",

        "- Error handling in Flask APIs is crucial for providing informative responses to clients when something goes wrong. Here's a breakdown of how it's typically done:\n",
        "  *  Built-in HTTP Exceptions: Flask uses Werkzeug's HTTP exceptions, which map to standard HTTP status codes. You can raise these exceptions directly to return appropriate error responses. Common examples include: abort(400): Bad Request, abort(401): Unauthorized, abort(404): Not Found, and abort(500): Internal Server Error.\n",
        "\n",
        "  *  Custom Error Handlers: You can define custom functions to handle specific exception types using the @app.errorhandler decorator. This allows you to format error responses consistently, such as returning JSON instead of HTML.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. How do you connect Flask to a SQL database?\n",
        "- To connect to a SQL Server database, you'll typically use SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), a tool that allows you to connect, query, and manage SQL Server databases. You'll need to specify the server name (or IP address), authentication method (Windows or SQL Server Authentication), and optionally, the database name.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is the role of Flask-SQLAlchemy?\n",
        "- Flask SQLAlchemy enables developers to perform tasks like defining models, creating queries, and easily managing database migrations and supports multiple database management systems such as SQLite, MySQL, and PostgreSQL.\n",

        "- Each Flask Blueprint is an object that works very similarly to a Flask application. They both can have resources, such as static files, templates, and views that are associated with routes. However, a Flask Blueprint is not actually an application. It needs to be registered in an application before you can run it.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is the purpose of Flask's request object?\n",
        "- The Flask request object is a crucial part of the framework, acting as a central hub for all incoming data from a client's web browser. It encapsulates the details of an HTTP request, making it accessible within Flask's view functions.\n",
